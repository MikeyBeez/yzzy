# yzzy
Agent for bard AI

On Google 
You need a Google Cloud account.  Set one up.  
Create a project.  
Enable the vertexai API within your new project.  
I'm not using the vertex API here.  That API is expensive.
I think the way I'm doing it is free.  
Create an access token.  

On you local machine
Clone this repository 
Create a virtual environment called yzzy 
activate the environment
install gloud
initialize and authenticate gloud
add the project


etc. . . . 



notes:  The say command and any voice synthesizer breaks with miniconda.  Use Anaconda.
